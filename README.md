# Fastag Fraud Detection

## Overview
Fastag Fraud Detection is a machine learning-based system designed to identify fraudulent transactions in electronic toll collection. It leverages image and text analysis techniques to detect anomalies and potential fraud cases efficiently.

## Features
- Image-based fraud detection using deep learning models
- Text-based analysis for transaction validation
- Combination of CNNs and NLP models for robust detection
- High scalability and accuracy for real-time fraud detection

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fastag-fraud-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fastag-fraud-detection
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fastag-fraud-detection.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
- Upload the necessary transaction and image datasets.
- Run the notebook to preprocess the data and train the fraud detection model.
- Evaluate the model's performance using validation metrics.
- Deploy the model for real-time fraud detection.

## Dataset
Ensure you have the required dataset stored in the following directories:
- Training images: `/content/train_images`
- Test images: `/content/test_images`
- CSV data:
  - Train: `/content/drive/MyDrive/Participant Resources/student_resource_3/dataset/train.csv`
  - Test: `/content/drive/MyDrive/Participant Resources/student_resource_3/dataset/test.csv`
